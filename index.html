                        <p class="illuminated text-lg leading-relaxed">In the beginning, there was One Being, and all was good. This Being then said "I'm bored." So, with the tip of its fedora, it created everything. It morphed into 4 parts. The first piece went to become a new being named God, and it was good. The second, named itself Satan, and it was bad. The third and fourth pieces morphed together, to create a being called Kai, and he was dank. With the tip of His fedora, Kai made all of humanity. He made the humans. He made the plants. He made the birds of the sky. He made the animals of the sea. Kai could morph into any of these creatures, just in case. Kai then found that the smart earthlings would soon come to fly around the galaxy, and might find themselves lonely. So, he took His fedora, and within one flip, he had made alien life. Not only had Kai made these creatures, but Kai was these creatures. Kai was everything.</p>

                        <p class="illuminated text-lg leading-relaxed">The first humans put on this planet were named Spicy and Meme. They lived in the land of Kaia. There was a tree. It had Holy Apples. For some odd reason, they weren't allowed to stick pens in these fruits. Kai knows all. Have mercy. Bless us. Then, they stuck their pens in the apples and "Boom" Apple Pen! The world was made. There were about 7 billion people who were outcasts and spilled out of the group of Kaiites. The Kaiites went to form Kaia, the wonderful country in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We think it was a small island. The Kaiites were blessed.</p>

He told the birds of the sky how to hunt off of the People of the Earth, by picking up any food scraps that they drop.</p>

The two Holy Birds flew up and turned into a giant red aura and shot up into the sky.</p>

So in the end, Euphranor sacrificed himself for the creation of the heavens. Kai went into a deep slumber. God and Satan ruled the earth equally. Later that million year period, Kai was awoken by a big noise. He said, "Whereth doeseth theeth soundeth cometh frometh?" So Kai was relieved to know that he was in doom, again. The plants of the world were being roasted. Leafy is here.</p>

But then, Kai remembered about the crisis on earth, and he went on to save it. He asked his son to go and find the human girl named Tabitha.</p>

And all of the generations after these grandchildren. You will start walking east until you find a bunch of people trying to slice you in half with swords, then you will be a land called North Korea. In the future, you might see a man called Kim Jung Un come into power, and that will be a catastrophic day. You are to gather all of your things for the next 2 days, and on the third, you will start on your voyage, and will never come back. You will make a land that follows your own name As, and they will be called Asians. They will live in Asia. They will make clothing for you, and most of them will be children." And as was told to him by god, As did. As started walking towards the East Sea. He found the rumored Korea that was being spoken of.</p>

Then, a man with a "Make America Great Again" hat came onto him. He said, "I am Tskudki, I am the Creator. You will either call be Buddha or die." As said, "I only worship The Creator, and am not a believer in this Buddha you speak of. I am going to die." And with that, As died. He fell to the floor at the age of one thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight years and sixty-nine days. This was the end of who came to be known as As.</p>

They had control of the world. If they wanted to destroy Mongolia, they could. If they wanted to decimate Russia, they could. Al gathered some sticks and started to rebuild the land bridge.</p>

After several minutes, nothing happened. Then, Jehu came onto Al saying "Al, you are one of the best of all of the architects in the world. So I, my father As, and my grandfather who is The Creator, ask you to make a new realm for The Creator, unlike heaven, nor hell, nor earth. It shall be called the Space-Kaim." Al gladly accepted to become the architect of the Space-Kaim. He began the next day, ditching the whole Land Bridge idea.</p>

He promised the Iraqi people that he would kick out all of the illegal white immigrants, that he was going to build a wall across who knows where. The people hated it, but because of illegal Russian hackers, he won. Jehu was the president of the Iraqi offices. This means that he was a non-biased opinion for all of his life who would do what the people want, and exactly what the people want, and that he would not have a say. Jehu built the Black House in Baghdad and started his reign. He met a girl named Banu. She and him would conceive. When Jehu came into her, this will come to be known as the Conception of Emil. 2 days after his conception, Banu bore Emil. During childbirth, Banu died.
